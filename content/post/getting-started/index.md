## Statement of Candidacy for the position of Governing Board Member 2021-2023

Dear Colleague,

It has been a great privilege for me to be a member of the Governing Board for the last two years working with great colleagues from around the world. I have gained a great understanding of the workings, capabilities, and challenges that face our Federation.

I've been active for nearly 10 years in IFLA in many of their sections and activities; working closely with the LAC Region and the FAIFE Committee, being part of the second cohort of the IFLA International Leaders, advocating for Access to Information, working on several IFLA initiatives as the Global Vision, the IFLA Strategy and the new Governance. This experience has encouraged me to continue working for IFLA with strong convictions; connecting and empowering the library field, expanding opportunities for new librarians, and building strong relationships with strategic allies.

I am running for second and last term at the Governing Board. My work will focus on bringing new generations of librarians into the association to become library leaders, as well as reinforcing the cultural and linguistic diversity of IFLA. If elected, I will use my experience, energy, and passion for the benefit of our Federation.

Supported by the Mexican Library Association (AMBAC) and the Library and Information Research Institute (IIBI), I kindly ask you to nominate me for IFLA Governing Board member and to vote for me in the upcoming elections.

Thank you,

Jonathan HernÃ¡ndez
